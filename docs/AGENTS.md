## ChromaDB Integration

Each agent leverages ChromaDB for enhanced performance:

### Context Retrieval
- Agents retrieve relevant past content before generation
- Reduces redundancy and maintains consistency
- Provides examples of successful content

### Knowledge Grounding
- Access to product documentation and specifications
- Brand guidelines and style requirements
- Technical accuracy through RAG

### Performance Learning
- High-performing content promoted to style examples
- Agents learn from engagement metrics
- Continuous improvement through feedback loops

## Agent Orchestration

The `controller.py` manages agent execution:

1. **Sequential Steps**:
   - Planner creates brief
   - Content generation (parallel)
   - Visual generation
   - Editorial review
   - Guardrail validation

2. **Parallel Execution**:
   - Blog, X Dev, X Creator, and LinkedIn writers work simultaneously
   - Reduces total generation time

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Retry logic for transient failures
   - Guardrails prevent low-quality output
   - Fallback strategies for API failures

## Extending the System

To add a new agent:

1. Define agent in `agents_setup.py`
2. Create output contract in `content_contracts.py`
3. Add orchestration logic in `controller.py`
4. Configure retrieval strategy in `retrieval.py`
5. Update guardrails if needed

## Performance Metrics

Typical generation times:
- Brief creation: 3-5 seconds
- Parallel content: 10-15 seconds
- Visual generation: 5-10 seconds
- Total package: 20-30 seconds

With ChromaDB caching:
- 30% faster for similar requests
- 50% reduction in API calls for knowledge retrieval
